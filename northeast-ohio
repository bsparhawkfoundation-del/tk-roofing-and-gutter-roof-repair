    <!-- SIGNS YOU NEED REPAIR -->
    <section>
        <h2>How to Know If Your Roof Needs Repair</h2>
        <p>Identifying when your roof needs repair can prevent further damage and save you significant costs in the long run. If you notice any of these warning signs, contact a professional immediately:</p>
        
        <h3>Common Signs Your Roof Needs Repair</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing or damaged shingles:</strong> Cracked, curled, or missing shingles expose your roof decking and underlayment to water infiltration and weather damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Roof leaks and water stains:</strong> Ceiling or wall stains indicate active water infiltration, which can lead to structural damage within 12 months if left unaddressed.</li>
            <li><strong>Damaged flashing:</strong> Flashing prevents water from seeping into the roof's joints, valleys, and vents. Damaged or missing flashing is a clear sign your roof requires repair.</li>
            <li><strong>Damaged soffit, fascia, or gutters:</strong> These elements protect your roof, attic, and home exterior. Damage here can allow pests, moisture, and debris into your attic space.</li>
            <li><strong>Ice dam or water backup damage:</strong> Ice dams form at roof edges and prevent melting snow from draining. Backed-up water can leak into your home, causing significant damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Hail or wind damage:</strong> After storms, look for missing shingles, dents in metal roofing, or damaged ridge vents indicating weather-related damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Roof age over 20 years:</strong> Most Ohio roofs last 20–25 years before needing major repairs. Even without visible damage, age-related wear compromises protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Don't wait:</strong> Minor leaks can escalate quickly. Call us at (330) 858-2616 for a free inspection, or request an estimate below.</p>
